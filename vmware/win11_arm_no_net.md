### Deploying a Win11 ARM guest on Fusion


After the first phase of the install is done, you'll get to a screen that 
says you need a network connection to get further. 

1. Func + Shift + F10
2. At that command prompt: `\OOBE\BYPASSNRO`

Things will progress and restart. Install the VMware tools and reboot, then you'll
have a network.
